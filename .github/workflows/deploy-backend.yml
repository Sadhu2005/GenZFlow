# Backend CI/CD - Use Render Auto-Deploy Instead
# This workflow is disabled in favor of Render's built-in GitHub integration
# 
# To enable automatic deployment:
# 1. Go to Render.com dashboard
# 2. Select your backend service
# 3. Go to Settings â†’ Build & Deploy
# 4. Enable "Auto-Deploy" and set branch to "main"
# 5. Save settings
#
# This is much simpler and more reliable than GitHub Actions for Render deployment
